üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get Wanderlust up and running on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Wanderlust.git
cd Wanderlust

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project and add the following:

DB_URL=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
MAP_TILE_TOKEN=YOUR_MAPTILER_API_KEY
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
SECRET=YOUR_SESSION_SECRET_KEY

Replace YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING with your MongoDB connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/wanderlust for local or a MongoDB Atlas URI).

Replace YOUR_MAPTILER_API_KEY with your API key from your MapTiler Cloud account.

Replace YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, and YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET with your credentials from your Cloudinary dashboard.

Replace YOUR_SESSION_SECRET_KEY with a strong, random string for express-session.
